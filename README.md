## Technical Write-up

### 1. Architecture and Design Choices

Built a serverless newsletter automation system with multi-framework support and Zapier email integration. Key decisions focused on cost optimization, scalability, and developer experience.

#### **Core Requirements**
- Multi-framework automation (Playwright, Skyvern AI, Browserbase)
- Reliable email processing pipeline via Zapier webhooks
- Real-time UI with status tracking
- Production scalability without manual intervention

#### **Architecture Decisions**

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15.5.4 + TypeScript | Full-stack solution, built-in API routes |
| **Backend** | AWS Lambda | Auto-scaling, pay-per-use model |
| **Database** | DynamoDB | Single-digit ms queries, serverless |
| **Email** | Zapier Integration | No SMTP maintenance, multi-provider support |
| **Deployment** | SST + AWS | Infrastructure as code, automatic deployments |

#### **System Architecture**

                                                              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ n8n ‚Üí Google Sheets
```

#### **Key Design Principles**
- **Modularity**: Isolated framework implementations with clean separation
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms and retry logic
- **Performance**: Serverless scaling, CDN distribution, optimized queries
- **Security**: Environment variables, HTTPS, IAM least-privilege

#### **Production Environment**
- **Stage**: `production` (protected from deletion)
- **Region**: `us-east-1` (global access optimization)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics
- **Backup**: Automatic DynamoDB backups and S3 versioning

### 2. Zapier Integration Architecture

The system uses **Zapier for email forwarding** instead of traditional SMTP/email services. This provides better reliability, easier setup, and seamless integration with various email providers.

#### **How Zapier Integration Works**

**Email Flow:**
1. **Newsletter Subscription** ‚Üí User subscribes to newsletters via automation
2. **Email Forwarding** ‚Üí Zapier forwards newsletter emails to our webhook
3. **Email Processing** ‚Üí System processes emails via `/api/email-webhook`
4. **Link Extraction** ‚Üí AI extracts and categorizes links
5. **Data Storage** ‚Üí Links stored in DynamoDB and exported to Google Sheets

**Zapier Workflow Setup:**

```yaml
Trigger: Email Received (Gmail/Outlook/etc.)
Action: Webhook POST to https://d3h2cnptvg31ji.cloudfront.net/api/email-webhook
Data Format: JSON with email content, subject, sender, body
```

**Webhook Configuration:**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/email-webhook`
- **Authentication**: API key validation (optional)
- **Data Format**: JSON with email metadata and content
- **Response**: Success confirmation with extracted links count

**Benefits of Zapier Integration:**
- **No SMTP Configuration**: Eliminates email server setup complexity
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.
- **Reliable Delivery**: Zapier handles email forwarding reliability
- **Easy Setup**: Visual workflow builder, no coding required
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple email accounts and providers

**Zapier Setup Instructions:**

1. **Create Zapier Account**: Sign up at zapier.com
2. **Create New Zap**: Choose "Email" as trigger
3. **Configure Email Trigger**: Connect your email account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. **Set Up Webhook Action**: 
   - Action: "Webhooks by Zapier"
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://d3h2cnptvg31ji.cloudfront.net/api/email-webhook`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
5. **Map Email Data**: Send email content, subject, sender to webhook
6. **Test & Activate**: Test the integration and activate the Zap

**Email Processing Pipeline:**

```javascript
// Webhook receives email data from Zapier
const emailData = {
  from: "newsletter@example.com",
  subject: "Weekly Tech Newsletter",
  body: "Check out these links...",
  html: "<html>...</html>",
  date: "2025-10-06T10:00:00Z"
};

// System processes and extracts links
const result = await emailService.processIncomingEmail(emailData);
// Returns: { success: true, linksExtracted: 5, links: [...] }
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Zero Email Server Maintenance**: No SMTP servers to manage
- **Universal Email Support**: Works with any email provider Zapier supports
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Zapier handles failed webhook calls
- **Visual Monitoring**: See email processing status in Zapier dashboard
- **Easy Troubleshooting**: Clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### 3. Newsletter Detection Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated two-step detection process to find newsletter signups:

#### **Step 1: Direct Form Detection**

First, the system searches the current page for email signup forms using comprehensive selectors:

```javascript
// Email field detection patterns
input[type="email"]                    // Standard email inputs
input[name*="email" i]                 // Name contains "email" (case-insensitive)
input[placeholder*="Enter your email" i] // Placeholder text patterns
input[name*="subscribe" i]            // Subscribe-related names
input[placeholder*="newsletter" i]    // Newsletter-related placeholders
input[name*="signup" i]               // Signup-related names
input[placeholder*="join" i]         // Join-related placeholders
input[name*="updates" i]              // Updates-related names
// ... and many more patterns
```

#### **Step 2: Newsletter Link Discovery**

If no direct form is found, the system searches for newsletter/subscribe links in headers and footers:

```javascript
// Link detection patterns
Links with text: "News", "Subscribe", "Newsletter", "Signup", "Join"
Links with href containing: "newsletter", "subscribe", "signup", "join"
Product Hunt specific: links to "/newsletters" with "campaign=weekly_newsletter"
```

The system then follows these links to find the actual signup form.

#### **Step 3: Form Interaction**

Once an email field is found:

1. Fill the email field with the provided email
2. Find and click the submit button
3. Wait for confirmation or success message
4. Return success result

### 4. Automation Framework Comparison

Evaluated three automation approaches for newsletter signup automation, focusing on performance, cost, and reliability in production environments.

#### **Testing Methodology**
- **Environment**: Production AWS Lambda
- **Sites**: Real newsletter sites with live forms
- **Metrics**: Success rate, processing time, cost per attempt
- **Runs**: 10+ attempts per framework per site

#### **Framework Analysis**

**Playwright (Traditional Browser Automation)**
```javascript
// Direct browser control with CSS selectors
const emailSelectors = [
  'input[type="email"]',
  'input[name*="email" i]',
  'input[placeholder*="email" i]',
  // ... 20+ patterns
];
```

## Conclusion

This newsletter automation system successfully demonstrates how modern serverless architecture can solve real-world automation challenges. I built a production-ready system that automatically processes newsletters and extracts valuable links using AI.

My three-framework comparison provided valuable insights for choosing the right automation approach. Playwright emerged as the most reliable and cost-effective solution, while Skyvern and Browserbase offer specialized capabilities for different use cases.

The production testing revealed robust performance across all core functionalities. While newsletter sites change frequently (a common challenge in web automation), my system handles these changes gracefully and maintains stability.

The system is ready for production use and serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements. The modular architecture allows me to add new features incrementally while maintaining the reliability and performance I've achieved.
