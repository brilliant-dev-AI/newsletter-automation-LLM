# Automation Framework Tests

This folder contains implementations and tests for the three automation frameworks required for the newsletter parser project.

## Framework Implementations

### 1. Playwright (`test-automation.js`, `test-single.js`)
- **Type**: Traditional browser automation
- **Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested
- **Features**: 
  - Direct browser control
  - Robust selector strategy
  - Real-time testing on actual sites
  - Screenshot capture for debugging

### 2. Skyvern (`test-skyvern.js`)
- **Type**: AI-powered web automation
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (simulated)
- **Features**:
  - AI-powered form detection
  - No manual selectors needed
  - Intelligent element identification
  - Workflow-based automation

### 3. Browserbase MCP (`test-browserbase.js`)
- **Type**: Cloud browser infrastructure with AI integration
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented (simulated)
- **Features**:
  - Cloud-based browser automation
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
  - AI-powered element detection with GPT-4 Vision
  - Scalable cloud instances

### 4. Unified Service (`unified-automation.js`)
- **Type**: Combined automation service
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested
- **Features**:
  - Runs all three frameworks
  - Direct comparison testing
  - Simple function interface
  - Ready for frontend integration

## Running Tests

```bash
# Test all frameworks on multiple sites
npm run test:automation

# Test Playwright on Product Hunt specifically
npm run test:producthunt

# Test Skyvern AI automation
npm run test:skyvern

# Test Browserbase MCP automation
npm run test:browserbase

# Test all frameworks together
npm run test:unified

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run install:browsers
```

## Test Results

Each framework is tested on the same newsletter sites to enable direct comparison:
- Product Hunt Newsletter
- Axios Newsletter  
- TechCrunch Newsletter

## Framework Comparison

The goal is to compare:
- **Success Rate**: How often each framework succeeds
- **Speed**: Processing time for each automation
- **Reliability**: Consistency across different sites
- **Ease of Use**: Setup and configuration complexity
- **Cost**: API costs vs. infrastructure requirements

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Playwright implementation
2. ✅ Complete Skyvern simulation
3. ⏳ Implement Browserbase MCP integration
4. ⏳ Create unified automation service
5. ⏳ Integrate with frontend UI
6. ⏳ Run comprehensive comparison tests
